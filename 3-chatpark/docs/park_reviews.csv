It is nicely shaded by trees in the summer heat, and there are areas for picnicking with picnic tables along one side.  The climbing structure is perhaps small compared with Seger Park or Starr Garden, but full of activities like slides, monkey bars, suspension bridge and clubhouses.

Traffic is light on the cobblestoned residential streets that bracket the playground, but there are no gates to keep your little ones inside the park, so you'll need to keep an eye out that they don't wander away.  Every so often, there is some kind of fun fair or kid-friendly event that is used to raise money for the park.  There are flyers posted for schedules at the park, and on their website.

When I drive past the park, it is usually crowded on a daily basis with a diverse group of all ages and ethnicities.
I have utilized the basketball court for the past few months to play with my buddies on a weekly basis.
The basketball courts are poorly maintained. The baskets appear to have been built some 30 years ago by locals; the backboards are made of what appears to be plywood with a standard double-rim attached. The backboards are not attached well to the support, so bank-shots become a much different experience than usual. The courts need to be cleaned and repainted but the asphalt isn't in bad shape. The courts are covered in garbage: soda cans, bottle caps, pens, plastic bags...
There is usually a group of people smoking blunts but they don't bother anyone. There is a lot of interest in using the basketball courts, so it's confusing why they're so poorly maintained. The locals are really friendly who play basketball there, from really young kids to older men. Shout out to Todd and Nate Dogg. There is also a huge range of skills at any given time, from people in flip flops who appear to be throwing the ball at the backboard to kids that clearly play in leagues/for their school to people that used to play competitively.",3,ChIJ-btRQgDGxokRavFwlFZPh4A,Mifflin Square,39.919477,-75.156519

It means a lot to just stroll in and relax on a bench in this green area and become quietly absorbed in a book. The sight and presence of trees is so profoundly  comforting and may even stimulate genetic subliminal memories of forests and clean air  from a distant utopian past. Modern civilized living conditions have sadly created concrete jungles and a dulling of interactions with the natural world around us.",3,ChIJ0cFmtmrIxokRPX_t7cF9wWM,Palmer Park,39.97489,-75.13254

The photo is of a grove of cherry trees circling a former American Legion brick monument. The park is a 3-block flat expanse of grass on a hill with a view of the Septa line (it's close to Tacony station). There were a few park benches but no other park amentities except trees and grass. This park is close to the Tacony bridge into NJ  but no river view from it. Our dog enjoyed the grassy areas.",4,ChIJ1-dgbMu1xokRCmIU8JS1adE,Disston Park,40.022058,-75.04233

This course has three sets of nine holes - the final requiring more than the others for competitive scoring. Most baskets are accessible from the tee, and even more are clearly visible.

You‚Äôll see people exercising from early morning to late at night. They have events during the summer like movie nights and you‚Äôll see groups of people hanging out and enjoying the evening time.

Not the entire length is lit up at night so you do have to be mindful about that. I would be nervous walking by myself and having dark corners here and there but that‚Äôs more a night thing than anything else.

When the river gets flooded parts get impacted but the city does a good job maintaining the length of the park and it‚Äôs a great way to get to Kelly drive and the art museum!",5,ChIJ1QhLoknGxokRY1BxIaMBmEY,Schuylkill Banks,39.952195,-75.180653
